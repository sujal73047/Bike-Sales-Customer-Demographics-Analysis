Bike Sales Demographic Analysis Dashboard
Project Overview
This project features a dynamic Bike Sales Dashboard built in Excel to analyze the relationship between customer demographics and purchasing behavior. The analysis processes data across multiple variables—including income, age, and commute distance—to identify the most profitable customer segments for targeted marketing.

Key Features & Insights
Income Analysis: Visualized average income levels, identifying that male purchasers earn an average of $60,124 and female purchasers earn $55,774.

Age Trend Mapping: Identified the "Middle Age" bracket as the primary revenue driver with 383 purchases, significantly outperforming adolescents and seniors.

Commute Distance Correlation: Analyzed purchasing habits based on logistics, discovering that customers with a 0–1 mile commute are the most likely to purchase (200 units).

Interactive Slicers: Implemented 5 dynamic filters to allow users to drill down by Marital Status, Region, Education, Gender, and Number of Children.

Technical Stack
Microsoft Excel: Advanced PivotTables and PivotCharts.

Data Modeling: Created custom age brackets (Adolescent, Middle Age, Old) for better segmentation.

UI/UX Design: Integrated a clean slicer panel for enhanced dashboard usability.

How to Use
Filter Data: Use the slicers on the left to view specific regions (e.g., North America, Europe) or education levels.

Observe Trends: Hover over the data points in the Customer Age Trend or Customer Commute charts to see exact counts for purchasers vs. non-purchasers.

Identify Targets: Use the Avg Income chart to determine which income brackets are most responsive to sales efforts.
